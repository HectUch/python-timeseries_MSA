# python-timeseries_MSA

Author: Heitor Uchoa

This repository contains code to perform all to all alignment of power traces in the format *.trs using Multiple sequence alignment techniques (MAFFT : https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/).
The *.trs libraries are available in Riscure Git repository (https://github.com/Riscure/python-trsfile)

Although this work is focused on Power traces for side channel analysis, the idea can be used for alignment of multiple time series.
